Subsquid is a response to unscalable and rigid monolithic indexing frameworks that had previously gained popularity and market traction among Web3 developers, but that are failing to stay ahead in a rapidly changing blockchain landscape. Furthermore, the network serves as a tremendously efficient decentralized alternative to centralized infrastructure companies, including large RPC and API providers.",
